# 2015 - DAY 10

This puzzle revolves around a look-and-say sequence and the output is the
length of applying the sequence 40 times to the input.

## My Input

`1113222113`

## PART 1 ANSWER

`After 40 applications of LookAndSay the length is: 252594`

## PART 2 ANSWER

`After 50 applications of LookAndSay the length is: 3579328`

## Deno/Typescript

This wasn't too hard. Way easier than I had imagined because the look and say
sequence didn't make too much sense to me. I did think of doing some reduction
on the input string and some other functional methods but brute force
itterative stuff seemed easier to me. Given the length of the input it does
seem like this problem tests string handling in a language/runtime.
